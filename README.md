##TweakBlog Api 0.1

### about

This is a simple third-party library for Tweakblogs.net. As it is in very 
early development, I can't offer  many features.

Feel free to use, adapt it and please let me know if you've done something 
with it. Even if you don't want your project to be an example, it would still 
be fun for me to see it.

feedback is always appreciated

### help needed

I can't get the reaction form working. When downloading severside and sending 
clientside it doesn't work. It doesn't seem possible at first site to do it in 
javascript. (You can't use ajax to get another website) and an iframe is not ideal
at all (especially because I can not hide all irrelevant info and just show the form)

### features

current features:

	1.	get Blogs from a person
	2. 	get a Blog's content, title, description and reactions
	3.  get recent blogs

upcoming features

 2.	find title/description if it doesn't exist yet
 3.	hack comment, so that you can place comments via tweakblogs.net
 4.	get Blogs from multiple persons
 5.	whitelist/blacklist like features
 6.	cache blogs (save them and only load them again if version is older then x time)
 7.	get the time of the blogs
 8.	get blogs (from persons) newer than $time
