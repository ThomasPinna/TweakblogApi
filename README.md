##TweakBlog Api 0.1

### about

This is a simple third-party library for Tweakblogs.net. As it is in very 
early development, I can't offer  many features.

Feel free to use, adapt it and please let me know if you've done something 
with it. Even if you don't want your project to be an example, it would still 
be fun for me to see it.

feedback is always appreciated
